# Machine-learning-for-aquatic-plastic-litter-detection-and-classification
We made an application which uses a model using Mask RCNN that detects the plastic present in images that are fed to the system by user. The main idea behind the project is to provide an application that can detect plastic present in water bodies in a remote manner as major percentage of the waterbodies is not easily accessible to human being.
